After graduating from San Francisco State University with his M.Ed. in Instructional Technology, Steveâ€™s developed educational material across a broad spectrum of subjects for staff, students, and public audiences.</p>
                <p className="bio-para2">Steve has interviewed landowners under the canopy of redwood forests, videotaped rodents for veterinarians, and built a health information website for a federal technology program.  Along the way, he has even made several mandatory compliance courses easier to bear.</p>

            <p className="partner">Our Partners</p>
            <p className="partner-txt">The majority of our development work is done in-house. When needed, we also leverage our network of trusted partners to help provide a dynamic suite of digital media such as documentary-style videos, 3-D graphic animation, voiceover artists, infographics, and translation services. This structure allows Verse Learning to keep our prices lower than many of our competitors, while also maintaining a high level of expertise and quality.</p>
